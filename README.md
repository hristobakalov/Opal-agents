# Opal Agents

A collection of custom agents I've built for [Optimizely Opal](https://www.optimizely.com/opal/).

These are practical tools as Opal agents — demos, examples, and things I actually use.

## Agents

### Experiment Results Agent
Analyzes experiment results and generates formatted summaries. Useful for reporting and stakeholder updates.

### RICE Prioritization Board
A Canvas-based tool for scoring experiment ideas using the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). Calculates composite scores and ranks ideas by priority.

## Usage

1. Copy the JSON content of the agent you want
2. In Opal, import a new custom agent
3. Paste the configuration
4. Run it
